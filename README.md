# odoo_kanban_graph_color
This module allows you to color the graphs used in kanban dashboards.

**Usage:**

- 12 colors are defined against each month of the year in the basic_fields.js field. (_If you want, you can change the colors by changing the respective hex codes_)
- pass 'show_month_color' flag from your kanban dashboard graph data alongwith the month shortname as a label. (_You can use 'value' instead of 'label' also_)
